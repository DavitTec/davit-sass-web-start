# Legacy Print & Desktop Publishing Terminology

[TOC]

A curated reference of **classic newspaper, magazine, and early desktop publishing (DTP)** terms—useful for naming, structuring, and philosophically grounding modern **web/UI modular design systems**.

This list leans into **editorial, newspaper, magazine, and early DTP language**—the same mental models that inspired modern grids, components, and modular systems. It should slot nicely alongside concepts like **card, container, frame, and module**, while giving your system a more *editorial / typographic lineage* rather than purely tech jargon.

Use this document see ([Mapping Print Terms](#9-mapping-print-terms)) a naming reference for design systems, component libraries, CMS blocks, or editorial-style web frameworks.

## 10. Why These Terms Still Matter

Print terminology emphasizes **intentional structure, hierarchy, and rhythm**—principles that modern CSS grids, component libraries, and design systems still rely on. Using these terms can:

- Add editorial gravitas to design systems
- Encourage modular, content-first thinking
- Differentiate your design language from purely tech-driven jargon
